**aioartnet** is a pure python asyncio connector for the [royalty-free Art-Net protocol](https://art-net.org.uk/background/), which is a transport to transmit and recieve the [DMX-512 lighting control protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX512) over Ethernet (UDP). The protocol is the modern standard for interconnecting complex lighting fixtures directly, and for branching out individual universes for a specific local area to control classic DMX-512 XLR-cable interlinked fixtures. Both open and propriety lighting control systems can emit Art-Net directly.

This library aims to be simple and robust, and can both input data into Art-Net, as well as output it from "artnet" to your user code. It builds a dynamic model of the network's Art-Net nodes, their ports and the universe(s) of DMX-512 that are being controlled. Fully type hinted to comply with `PEP-561`. No non-core dependancies, with a test suite that runs on Python 3.9 to 3.11.

It can also be used __passively__ to build the network model without joining as an Art-Net Node.

We also have a propriety iOS/Xcode component available for commercial licensing that uses the same event driven API as this code. This will be a significantly better starting point for new designs than [libartnet](https://github.com/OpenLightingProject/libartnet) for most projects.
